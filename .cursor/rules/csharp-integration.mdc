# C# Integration

The library can be used from C# with P/Invoke. Examples are in [README.md](mdc:README.md).

Integration patterns:
1. Import functions with `DllImport`
2. Use the library to start and manage processes
3. Handle data streaming with stdin/stderr
4. Always close processes when done to prevent leaks

Example usage:
```csharp
[DllImport("betahub_process_wrapper", CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
private static extern IntPtr process_start_with_args(string program, string[] args, UIntPtr args_len);
```
```
